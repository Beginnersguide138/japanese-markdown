# Requirements Document

## Introduction

JAMdown Pad is a web application that solves the frequent switching problem between Japanese input (full-width characters) and markup input (half-width characters) in Markdown writing. The application provides seamless interpretation and conversion between Japanese-style custom notation using full-width symbols and standard Markdown notation using half-width symbols, improving document creation efficiency for Japanese users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Live Editor Functionality

**User Story:** As a Japanese Markdown user, I want a real-time editor that supports both full-width and half-width Markdown syntax, so that I can write without worrying about input mode switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the left editor pane THEN the system SHALL display real-time HTML preview in the right pane
2. WHEN the user inputs full-width Markdown symbols (＃, ＊, ＞, etc.) THEN the system SHALL automatically normalize them to standard half-width symbols before rendering
3. WHEN the user inputs standard half-width Markdown symbols THEN the system SHALL render them directly without modification
4. WHEN the user mixes both full-width and half-width syntax in the same document THEN the system SHALL correctly interpret and render both formats seamlessly

### Requirement 2: File Download and Export

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my work in standard formats, so that I can use the content in other applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Download as .md" button THEN the system SHALL convert all content to standard half-width Markdown and download as a .md file
2. WHEN the user clicks the "Copy HTML" button THEN the system SHALL copy the rendered HTML source to the clipboard
3. WHEN exporting content THEN the system SHALL ensure all Japanese notation is properly converted to standard Markdown format

### Requirement 3: File Converter Functionality

**User Story:** As a user with existing .jamd or .md files, I want to convert them using the same normalization logic, so that I can standardize my existing documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a local file using the file input THEN the system SHALL read and process .jamd or .md files
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL apply the same normalization logic as the live editor
3. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a .md file with standardized notation and prompt for download

### Requirement 4: Japanese Markdown Notation Support

**User Story:** As a Japanese user, I want to use intuitive full-width symbols for Markdown formatting, so that I can write more naturally without switching input modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types "＃" THEN the system SHALL convert it to "#" for heading level 1
2. WHEN the user types "＃＃" through "＃＃＃＃＃＃" THEN the system SHALL convert to "##" through "######" respectively
3. WHEN the user types "＊＊text＊＊" THEN the system SHALL convert to "**text**" for bold formatting
4. WHEN the user types "＊text＊" THEN the system SHALL convert to "*text*" for italic formatting
5. WHEN the user types "＞" THEN the system SHALL convert to ">" for blockquotes
6. WHEN the user types "「link name」（URL）" THEN the system SHALL convert to "[link name](URL)" for links
7. WHEN the user types "｀｀｀language" THEN the system SHALL convert to "```language" for code blocks
8. WHEN the user types "＊＊＊" or "ーーー" THEN the system SHALL convert to "***" or "---" for horizontal rules
9. WHEN the user types "・" THEN the system SHALL convert to "*" for bullet lists
10. WHEN the user types "１．" THEN the system SHALL convert to "1." for numbered lists

### Requirement 5: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when typing, so that I can see my formatting changes without any noticeable delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the editor THEN the preview SHALL update without perceptible delay
2. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
3. WHEN converting notation THEN the system SHALL complete processing within acceptable time limits for user experience

### Requirement 6: Static Web Application Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application reliably from anywhere, so that I can use it whenever I need to work with Markdown.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be a single HTML file with all dependencies
2. WHEN users access the application THEN all processing SHALL occur client-side without server dependencies
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL include marked.js library via CDN for Markdown processing
4. WHEN hosted on Amazon S3 THEN the application SHALL be accessible as a static website with high availability

### Requirement 7: User Interface Design

**User Story:** As a new user, I want an intuitive interface that clearly shows how to use the application, so that I can start using it immediately without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application THEN they SHALL see a clean, minimal design with clear purpose
2. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the user SHALL see a two-pane layout with editor on the left and preview on the right
3. WHEN looking at the interface THEN the user SHALL immediately understand the application's purpose and usage
4. WHEN interacting with controls THEN all buttons and inputs SHALL be clearly labeled and intuitive

### Requirement 8: .jamd File Format Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to work with .jamd files that indicate support for Japanese Markdown notation, so that I can clearly identify files that use this hybrid format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with files THEN the system SHALL recognize .jamd as the preferred extension for Japanese Markdown
2. WHEN processing .jamd files THEN the system SHALL expect mixed Japanese and standard notation
3. WHEN saving or exporting THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with standard .md format for broader tool support
